h2. Description

Rda(Rails Development Assist) is combined with lots of useful rake tasks which
can help you to setup your development enviroments and tools more quickly.

h2. Features

* Setup RVM for your rails application
* Deploy your rails application to Nginx (rails_env is set to development by default)
* Release your rails application

h2. Usage

h3. Installation

<code>gem install rda</code>

Or simply add the gem into Gemfile

<code>gem 'rda'</code>

h3. Setup RVM

<code>rake rda:rvm:setup</code>

First of all, this task will check whether the RVM is installed. If RVM is installed,
it will create a .rvmrc for the application with the content which looks like:

<pre>
<code>
if [[ -s "/path/to/rvm/environments/ruby-1.9.3-p0@app_name" ]]; then
  . "/path/to/rvm/environments/ruby-1.9.3-p0@app_name"
else
  rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p0@app_name --create
fi
</code>
</pre>

If RVM is not installed this task will do nothing but exit.

h3. Setup Nginx(not yet)

<code>rake rda:nginx:setup</code>

h3. Release your rails application(not yet)

<code> rake rda:release</code>

h2. License

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
